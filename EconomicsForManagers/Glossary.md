###### accounting profits. Accounting profits are the difference between revenues and actual explicit costs incurred.

###### adverse selection. Adverse selection occurs when incomplete or asymmetric information describes an economic relationship.

###### asymmetric information. Asymmetric information is where at least one party in an economic relationship has less than full information and has a different amount of information from another party.

###### average fixed cost. Average cost is the total fixed cost per unit of output.

###### average revenue. Average revenue is the price per unit sold.

###### average total cost (ATC). Average total cost (ATC) is the sum of all costs per unit of output.

###### average variable cost (AVC). Average variable cost (AVC) is the total variable cost per unit of output.

B
C
###### capital. The buildings, machinery, equipment, and software used in producing goods and services comprise the firm’s capital.

###### cardinal utility. Cardinal utility is a measurable concept of satisfaction.

###### comparative static analysis. Comparative static analysis compares an initial equilibrium with a new equilibrium, where the difference is due to a change in one of the other things that lie behind the demand curve or the supply curve.

###### complementary goods. When a price reduction (rise) for a related product increases (reduces) the demand for a primary product, it is a complement for the primary product.

###### consumer equilibrium. Consumer equilibrium occurs when marginal utility per dollar spent on the last unit of each good is equal.

###### corporation or company. A corporation or company is an organization with a legal identity separate from its owners that produces and trades.

###### cross-price elasticity of demand. Cross-price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a product divided by the percentage change in the price of another.

D
###### demand. The quantity of a good or service that buyers wish to purchase at each possible price, with all other influences on demand remaining unchanged.

###### demand curve. Graphical expression of the relationship between price and quantity demanded, with other influences remaining unchanged.

###### demand is elastic. Demand is elastic if the price elasticity is greater than unity. It is inelastic if the value lies between unity and 0. It is unit elastic if the value is exactly one.

###### diminishing marginal utility. It implies that the addition to total utility from each extra unit of a good or service consumed is declining.

E
###### economic profits. Economic profits are those profits measured as the difference between total revenue and total costs where the cost term includes the opportunity cost of the resources used in production.

###### elasticity of supply. Elasticity of supply is defined as the percentage change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price.

###### equilibrium price. It is the price at which quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied; it equilibrates the market.

###### excess demand (shortage). Excess demand exists when the quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied at the going price.

###### excess supply (surplus). Excess supply exists when the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at the going price.

F
###### fixed costs. Fixed costs are costs that are independent of the level of output.

G
H
I
###### income elasticity of demand. Income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by a percentage change in income.

###### inferior good. An inferior good is one whose demand falls in response to higher incomes. Inferior goods have a negative income elasticity.

J
K
L
###### law of demand. Law of demand states that, all other things being equal, more of a good is demanded the lower its price is.

###### law of diminishing marginal product. When increments of a variable factor (labor) are added to a fixed amount of another factor (capital), the marginal product of the variable factor must eventually decline.

###### long run. A period of time that is sufficient to enable all factors of production to be adjusted.

M
###### macroeconomics. Macroeconomics studies the economy as a system in which feedback among sectors determine national output, employment, and prices.

###### marginal cost. Marginal cost of production is the cost of producing each additional unit of output.

###### marginal revenue. Marginal revenue is the change in total revenue due to selling one more unit of a good.

###### marginal utility. It is the addition to total utility created when one more unit of a good or service is consumed.

###### market demand. The horizontal sum of individual demands.

###### microeconomics. It is the study of individual behavior in the context of scarcity.

N
###### normal good. Normal good is one whose demand increases in response to higher incomes.

###### normal profits. Normal profits are required to induce suppliers to supply their goods and services. They reflect opportunity costs and can therefore be considered as a type of cost component. Normal profits are when economic profits equal zero.

###### normative economics. Normative economics offers recommendations that incorporate value judgments.

O
###### opportunity cost. Opportunity cost of a choice is what must be sacrificed when a choice is made.

###### ordinal utility. Ordinal utility assumes that individuals can rank commodity bundles in accordance with the level of satisfaction associated with each bundle.

P
###### partnership. A business owned jointly by two or more individuals who share in the profits and are jointly responsible for losses.

###### point elasticity of demand. The elasticity computed at a particular point on the demand curve.

###### positive economics. Studies objective or scientific explanations of how the economy functions.

###### present value of a stream of future earnings. The sum of each year’s earnings divided by one plus the interest rate raised to the appropriate power.

###### price controls. Government rules or laws that inhibit the formation of market-determined prices.

###### price elasticity of demand. Measured as the percentage change in quantity demanded, divided by the percentage change in price.

###### production function. A technological relationship that specifies how much output can be produced with specific amounts of inputs economics.

###### profit maximization. It is the goal of proprietary firms – they seek to maximize the difference between revenues and costs.

Q
###### quantity demanded. Defines the amount purchased at a particular price.

###### quantity supplied. Refers to the amount supplied at a particular price.

R
###### regression line. Represents the average relationship between two variables in a scatter diagram.

S
###### shareholders. Shareholders invest in corporations and therefore are the owners. They have limited liability personally if the firm incurs losses.

###### short run. A period during which at least one factor of production is fixed. If capital is fixed, then more output is produced by using additional labor.

###### short run equilibrium. Occurs when each firm maximizes profit by producing a quantity where marginal revenue equals marginal cost at or above average variable cost.

###### short run total product. The relationship between total output produced and the amount of labor used, for a given amount of capital.

###### shutdown price. A price below AVC causes a firm to shutdown in the short run.

###### sole proprietor. The single owner of a business and is responsible for all profits and losses.

###### substitute goods. When a price reduction (rise) for a related product reduces (increases) the demand for a primary product, it is a substitute for the primary product.

###### supply. The quantity of a good or service that sellers are willing to sell at each possible price, with all other influences on supply remaining unchanged.

###### supply curve. A graphical expression of the relationship between price and quantity supplied, with other influences remaining unchanged.
