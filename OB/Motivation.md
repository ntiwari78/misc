##### Motivation Theories are categorized as 
1. Content Based Theory - Explains what motivates people
2. Process Based Theory - Explains how people are motivated
3. Outcome Based Theory - Explains why people are motivated

###### What motivates us?
1. Personal needs - Internal drivers - explaied by (a) Maslow's Pyramid (b) McClelland'e Need Theory
2. Nature of the job - External drivers
3. The goals we want to achieve - 

#### Internal drivers
###### Maslow's Pyramid(from bottom to top) - Physiological, Safety, Social, Esteem, Self Actualization . This is also called hierarchy of needs.

###### Criticism of Maslow's hierarchy of need:-
That Maslow establishes that you cannot aspire to higher-level needs until your lower-level needs are fulfilled. In reality, people can pursue various levels of needs simultaneously.

###### McClelland's Need
Need of achievement
Need of power
Need of affiliation
These need happen simultaneously but in varying degree. This has been proved emirically.

#### External drivers - The nature of our job
Motivation vs Hygiene factor(Herzberg)
Job Characteristics (Hackman and Oldham)
###### Herzberg's Two factor theory
Motivators  

 (a) Intrinsic Factors
 (b) Satisfaction if present
 (c) No satisfaction if absent
 
Hygiene Factros

 (a) Extrinsic Factors
 (b) No satisfaction if present
 (c) Dissatisfaction if absent
 
 ###### Job Characteristics Model
 1. Core Job Dimensions
 2. Psychological States
 3. Outcomes

 - High intrinsic motivation
 - High Job Performance
 - High Job Satisfaction
 - Low ansenteeism & turnover
     
 => Meaningfulness of work 
 => Responsibility of outcome 
 => Knowledge of result
 We want to be high on all these three parameters. What do we want our jobs to be look like? For managers, how do you design your work so that people are motivated.
